        <div>
            <p>We want to deliver a full fledged playground for any hobbiest at any level to learn complex java skills and knowledge without the challenge of software hindering your ability to learn a new software development concept</p>

            <p>We really want to deliver developers creating rest API's using the ClinkWorks-Platform, easy means to create their own applications with out of the box support for valuable development techniques and education about API design.</p>

            <p>
                The idea is that it is possible to create a simple system with minimum viable product design with modular service based architecture at the for front of our api choices.
                Taking this approach with strict test driven development with a focus on a service based architecture.
            </p>

            <p>We have decided that it was time to take our hobbiest nature to the next level. We want to provide tooling and know how to developers of any skill level seeking to build their own products</p>

        <h3>What are we creating</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                We are attempting to create a data broker called ClinkWorks-Platform
                that is as close to Java SE compliant as we can make it without adding any strict learning curves in any of the given supported technologies.
            </p>

            <p>One of the big things I felt as a new developer in the enterprise world is just how many different xml configuration files you were required to learn at a very quick pace. Xml files for conifguring databases, xml files for identifying constructors. xml files for this that and the other.</p>

            <p>Modern application development tooling is also so difficult to learn since you are never exposed to it in the achedemic world. So we decided to host a full fledged application stack including a CI server, multiple enviroment configurations for the build, and all that fun stuff.</p>
